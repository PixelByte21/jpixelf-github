                                    <p>Hoi, my name is Pixel, and I spent a long time creating this because I care about you and I don&rsquo;t want you to end your life. You are important. When reading this, I want you to imagine I&rsquo;m there saying it to you in person. This was created by someone who can relate. Due to my disabilities, my emotions are stronger than most other people’s. I have been through this since I was eight, and I am still here. If I can make it through with the amount of emotions that english can’t begin to describe, so can you. I have had a positive outcome in my life, but it took a decade to truly feel improvement. It might not be easy, and you may take a longer or shorter time than I did, but whatever happens…
KEEP GOING. You got this.</p>
<p>The first thing is that you need to think through the consequences of committing suicide very carefully. I once lived in a small town, and when I was going to school there, someone committed suicide. It turned the entire town quiet. Everyone I knew was crying, even some of the people who didn’t know them. What people don&rsquo;t understand is the ripple effect it causes. The people who know them and love them are upset and hurt. Then the people who know the people who know the one who commit suicide see that their friends/family is upset. Then those people go to work and school and have the same thing happen with the people around them. And all the people are upset because you can&rsquo;t do anything to help or fix it. YOU CANNOT FIX SOMEONE&rsquo;S SUICIDE, IT’S PERMANENT! The saddest part is that in their suicide note they said they thought no one cared and nobody would notice. Little did they know everyone in town would know and most would care in one way or another. Heck, you turn on the news and hear about mass shootings or terrorist attacks and your heart drops and you sympathise with the people. This is something that is ingrained into most people. Even if you don&rsquo;t know the person you still care because you understand the value of a human soul and a human life. People will and do care about you even if they don&rsquo;t know you. Suicide is an irreversible, permanent attempt to solve a temporary problem. I heard a clinical psychologist say that he once had a client who once had a son who committed suicide. Fifty years later, at the age of eighty, she was still going to therapy over it. Another client talked to their daughter twenty minutes before it happened. His daughter left him asking himself what he could do different to help, and he never forgave himself. You destroy people&rsquo;s hearts and lives when you do this. You might think you’re a burden now, but what will really be a burden is your death. You are loved. Love is a burden, but it&rsquo;s a burden worth bearing.</p>

                                    <p>One common reason you might  want to end your life is you feel you have no value. If you’re like that, I have a few points I wanna make. Every person is made in the image of God, who is divine; and therefore everyone has value. Even Hitler had value: he excelled in the area of leadership. Everyone has gifts, (that includes you,) and there is a lot of value in that. Do you think that art is valuable? People collect it, and it has sold for more than 450 million dollars. Some say there is no price you could put on it. Something about it is irreplaceable. Even exact replicas &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t the same”. Well, what if I told you that you yourself are also a piece of art? God made everything in existence. And everything he made is his art. He made you, you are art, and you are invaluable. If someone took the time to create a gift for you, like a nice painting, wouldn&rsquo;t it be wrong to rip it up? You’re a vessel of unique value. You’re what people call human. In most cultures, there’s nothing higher in value than a human soul because there is something about a person that cannot be replaced. You&rsquo;re no different. You have value in so many places, some you don&rsquo;t even know. When you take your own life, you leave a hole in the fabric of being itself. One that cannot be refilled or replaced. Did you think ten years ago, or even five years ago, that you would be where you are today? You don&rsquo;t know what your future holds. Even if you don&rsquo;t believe in a God who has a plan for you (He does) there is still a future that you don&rsquo;t know. And in that future everything could change for the better. You could make a big impact or be really successful. There is only one “you”. There can’t be another “you”. Therefore the world would be missing out on what you can offer, and the future impact you will make, if you take your own way out of life. Many things that could have been aren’t gonna be.</p>

                                    <p>&ldquo;Life Is Meaningless and Suffering&rdquo;</p>
<p>You might say your life is too hard.  Hard to a point that you want it to end. The thing is, we were made to adapt and become stronger through suffering, pain and trials. It builds character. In books, movies and video games the characters have to struggle. If they don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s bland and pointless. The best stories have the character overcome the greatest obstacles. If you only had a good and easy life you wouldn’t realize it was good because you never experienced bad. You need something to compare it to. You need a point of reference. Happiness shouldn’t be the ultimate goal. You should strive for contentment and joy. People who are rich have everything and their lives should feel great. They found happiness and success, but too many of them commit suicide and most are depressed. People who obtain happiness quickly realize that it doesn&rsquo;t last forever. It is very temporary. Then they want more to feel happy again. They eventually feel empty with everything they could ever want to have. Everything that makes people happy goes up and down. You feel happy, then it leaves. Happiness from things like Marriage, interests or material things can all leave. The people in third world countries seem the “happiest”. They often have little to nothing but are content with the little they have. They don&rsquo;t have happiness, but they have contentment and joy. They also have bad things in their lives, so that when they have good, they can recognize it. You need to have some bad. And the worse you have it, the stronger, braver, wiser and more mature and better person you should become after you overcome it. You will grow.</p>
<p>when you have been through a hard life one of two perspectives come out, one of two kinds of people. The person who loves and cares more about people because they understand how it feels, and the people who hate the world and wanna watch it burn. For the people who want to watch the world burn, I have something I want to say. Do you want to make your life better or worse? There is this idea of life (something some people describe as hell) being a bottomless pit. from a philosophy standpoint,  that is because no matter how bad life is there is always a way for some broken imperfect human being like you to make it infinitely worse.</p>
<p>“Life is suffering”:</p>
<p>one of the oldest lessons and teaching in all of religion and history. Well, what are you supposed to with that? You need to pick up your cross (the burden of life) and carry it voluntarily and willingly. Don&rsquo;t just accept your suffering but push through it. Instead of being shoved in whatever direction, you need to use your strength and walk. This will allow you to navigate your path, change and make progress in life. So how do you do that? Well, I&rsquo;m gonna bring something up that you have probably heard about but find it boring, pointless or it feels like work you don&rsquo;t wanna do. It’s called “responsibility”. Now wait, before you stop reading just hear me out. In society today, people suffer from depression and the feeling that life is pointless. These feelings are more common than ever before. Have you ever wondered why?</p>
<p>For several decades the family structure has been falling apart, and as a result people are not learning things they used to learn by unspoken means. Things like responsibility  (the act of taking control and initiative, holding yourself accountable) and postponed gratification (the act of waiting a while for a reward for what you have done) aren’t adopted naturally. In the family these two particular things are taught by the father without him even realizing it. Especially in boys. Males growing up without fathers are 80% of the teens in psychiatric hospitals, 90% of runaways and 73% of men in jail. Now, that being said, the mother can do the same, but it&rsquo;s less common and usually to less of a degree. Because of many reasons that I could ramble for paragraphs about, fathers aren&rsquo;t as common in families as they should be. And I believe this is what has caused the problem of people living lives that seem pointless and meaningless. The family structure, especially the way it used to be (which was based off a Christian foundation) was effective because everyone benefited from it positively. Without that structure, everything crumbles. Here is an example of how the father will teach responsibility and postponed gratification without even realizing it. Imagine the kids and the father are wrestling and they are having a blast. The mother comes in and says that it&rsquo;s time for the kids to shower, brush their teeth and get into their pajamas. The father agrees but adds one extra point. After they do all that and do it well, they can wrestle for a bit longer. Can you see how this works? The kids have to wait till they are done to get the reward (postponed gratification) and they had to be accountable to get that reward (responsibility). While the mother can fill this role too, it is much more difficult and less natural.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that the people around you who live meaningful lives have lots of responsibility?  Would you say family brings meaning in life? What about a job? Community? Religion? Christanity? &ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; most people would say. But the big question is: what do all of these have in common? The answer? They all involve taking responsibility in one way or another. It’s where meaning in life is found. Humans are made to be productive. It’s proven that if you do nothing but take part in the pleasures of life, no matter what they are, you feel empty (like the rich). We have to feel that we are contributing to something. When what you do matters, (job, family, community, Christianity) you know what you’re doing is meaningful and that gives your life meaning. It also makes you feel important because the role you&rsquo;re playing has value. If you&rsquo;re reading this because you’re suicidal, then chances are that you grew up fatherless (according to statistics). Try to look at the people who seem like their life is most fulfilling to you and see how they live life and try to imitate that in your own way. (Imagine taking a sentence someone gives you and putting it into your own words.) if everyone tried to improve themselves and got themselves together the suffering in the world would be so much less. Even if you just try to improve yourself and make yourself a better person, suffering would be less and the world will be that much better. Take some responsibility and see what happens! You might need more than one form of responsibility and it might take a long time to see positive results, but if you go into it with a good mindset and patience, you should have some results. Besides, what do you have to lose?</p>
<p>Now, forcing my beliefs on you is never my intent (even though I believe Christianity has the answers people are looking for). I want to point out that another thing studies have proven is that people who live Christian lives report living more meaningful lives than others (strange, it’s almost like we&rsquo;re made for that purpose or something). I know this to be true for myself too. It will change your life.</p>

                                    <h2 class="major">4) No One Cares</h2>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>I already touched a bit on this in the beginning where I explained how more people care then you understand. But I have more to say about it. A big reason I find people saying no one cares is because they are hanging with the wrong crowd: people who use you and don&rsquo;t care. Now if you’re wanting a group of great people, I would suggest a youth group/ young adult group. These usually consist of Christians but anyone is welcome. However, I recommend Christian friends for a reason. The number one commandment for them is to love their God with all their heart, soul, and mind. The second is basically to love both your enemies and your neighbour. This means to love everyone. To love people. According to the Bible: “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” Clearly, even if you don&rsquo;t agree with their beliefs, people who have been commanded to love as the number one rule in their life are good friends to have. People who truly put God first and follow him are the ones who will love you unconditionally. There is no guarantee that you will find loving people at youth groups, but a Christian community has the highest chance. If they don&rsquo;t, try to find another group. Another thing that I believe is that there is a God who created you and knew you before you were even made. He loved you since the beginning of time and still does now. One of God’s traits is love, and he has never ending grace. His love knows no bounds and is so abundant, we can&rsquo;t possibly begin to grasp it. Even if you believe no one on Earth cares, at least know God does. If you made the perfect piece of art, wouldn&rsquo;t you love it too? Especially if you yourself were a perfect creator. I&rsquo;m not saying you as a person are perfect, but I&rsquo;m saying you’re exactly as God intended you to be when he made you.</p>

                                    <p>Some people actually have chemical imbalances in the brain that causes them to always feel depressed or even suicidal. This can often be treated with medications like antidepressants. When people try antidepressants people sometimes take months to find the ones that work, even ten attempts or more, but in the end they feel happy and better, so wouldn&rsquo;t it be worth it? If you&rsquo;re feeling suicidal and depressed all the time, I would suggest seeing a doctor and telling them how long it&rsquo;s been lasting, especially if it&rsquo;s been 1.5 years or longer.</p>

                                    <p>A prison guard in Edmonton once said “you can always commit suicide tomorrow”. Kind of a weird statement at first, but it&rsquo;s true. In our society people always procrastinate about everything. &ldquo;I will mow the lawn tomorrow&rdquo; or &ldquo;Only five more minutes of this game before bed&rdquo;. Why not procrastinate about this too?  You can always just push it till tomorrow. So just do that. And do it some more. And do it till you can&rsquo;t do it anymore. Then do it again. Next I would say, what makes you think your life is yours to take? You don&rsquo;t own yourself like you do an object. If you feel suicidal you should see a doctor. It’s okay to seek help and you shouldn’t go through this alone.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried the Christian path by now, I
suggest you do. Even if you don’t, know that I care, and remember you are loved and worth it.</p>
